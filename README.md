# Mastering-OOP-Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Python-For-Beginners
This guide is written in **simple English** with examples, explanations, and exercises that even a **complete beginner** can understand.






## üìò What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a way of writing programs by organizing code into **objects** that represent real-life things ‚Äî like a **Car**, **Bank Account**, or **Animal**.

Each object has:
- **Attributes** (data/properties)
- **Methods** (functions/behavior)

---

## üöÄ Why Use OOP?

‚úÖ Keeps your code **organized**  
‚úÖ Makes it **reusable** (no need to rewrite everything)  
‚úÖ Makes your programs **easier to maintain and expand**  
‚úÖ Helps in **teamwork** and **large projects**

## üß± Four Pillars of OOP

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Abstraction**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Inheritance**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Encapsulation**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Polymorphism**

We‚Äôll explore each of them one by one üëá

---

## üß© 1. Abstraction

> üîπ Show only **essential information** and hide the **complex details**.

### Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractVehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def move(self):
        pass

class Car(AbstractVehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Car is moving")

car = Car()
car.move()
````

### Explanation

* `ABC` and `abstractmethod` help create an **abstract class**.
* `AbstractVehicle` is abstract ‚Üí you **cannot create an object** directly.
* It defines **what** a vehicle should do (move), but not **how**.
* `Car` class implements the `move()` method.
* Output ‚Üí `Car is moving`.

üß† **Key Idea:**
Abstraction defines **what** should be done, but **how** it‚Äôs done is left to subclasses.

---


## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ 2. Inheritance

> üîπ One class (child) can use the code of another class (parent).

### Example

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.speak())
print(cat.speak())
```

### Explanation

* `Animal` ‚Üí Parent (base) class
* `Dog` and `Cat` ‚Üí Child (derived) classes
* Both reuse `Animal`‚Äôs constructor
* Each defines its own version of `speak()`

üß† **Key Idea:**
Inheritance lets you **reuse** and **extend** existing code instead of rewriting it.

---

## üîí 3. Encapsulation

> üîπ Hide data and protect it from being directly modified.

### Example

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, id, balance=0):
        self.__id = id
        self.__balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            return amount
        return "Insufficient balance"

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = Account(1, 1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # 1500
account.withdraw(200)
print(account.get_balance())  # 1300
```

### Explanation

* Variables with `__` (double underscore) are **private**.
* They can‚Äôt be accessed directly ‚Äî only via **methods**.
* `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `get_balance()` are safe access methods.

üß† **Key Idea:**
Encapsulation **protects data** and ensures safe modification through methods.

---

## üîÅ 4. Polymorphism

> üîπ Same method name, but **different behavior** in different classes.

### Example

```python
class Rectangle:
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a rectangle"

class Circle:
    def draw(self):
        return "Drawing a circle"

def draw_shape(shape):
    print(shape.draw())

draw_shape(Rectangle())
draw_shape(Circle())
```

### Explanation

* Both classes define a method named `draw()`.
* The function `draw_shape()` doesn‚Äôt care what shape it is ‚Äî just calls `.draw()`.
* Each object responds in its **own unique way**.

üß† **Key Idea:**
Polymorphism = **one name**, **many forms**.

---

## üí† Bonus Concepts

### üß± Composition (Has-A Relationship)

> A class **contains** another class.

```python
class Battery:
    def charge(self):
        return "Battery charging"

class Smartphone:
    def __init__(self):
        self.battery = Battery()

    def charge_phone(self):
        return self.battery.charge()

phone = Smartphone()
print(phone.charge_phone())
```

üìò **Meaning:**
The `Smartphone` has a `Battery` ‚Äî if the phone dies, the battery is also gone.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Aggregation (Has-A but independent)

> A class uses another class, but both can exist separately.

```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine starts")

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine

    def start(self):
        self.engine.start()

engine = Engine()
car = Car(engine)
car.start()
```

üìò **Meaning:**
The `Engine` can exist even if the `Car` object is deleted.

---

### üîó Association

> General relationship between two classes.

```python
class Professor:
    pass

class Department:
    def __init__(self, professor):
        self.professor = professor
```

üìò **Meaning:**
Both `Professor` and `Department` can exist independently.

---

## üß¨ Method Resolution Order (MRO)

> Determines the order in which inherited methods are called.

```python
class A:
    def do_something(self):
        print("Method Defined In: A")

class B(A):
    def do_something(self):
        print("Method Defined In: B")

class C(A):
    def do_something(self):
        print("Method Defined In: C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.do_something()
```

‚û°Ô∏è Output: `Method Defined In: B`
Python follows this order: `D ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A`.
